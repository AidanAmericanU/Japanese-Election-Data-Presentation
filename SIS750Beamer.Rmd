## Overview and Data Summary

This presentation is focused on the effect that Japanese Welfare spending has on the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) electoral success in elections. Japan is often considered a "dominant party democracy", where the LDP consistently wins elections with a large plurality of support. I collected election data publicly available from the Japanese government in the 2017 and 2021 general elections. I matched this with welfare spending data from 2015 and 2020, as those were the closest years available to both of those elections. I did this as the LDP's voter base leans older, and relies much more heavily on welfare programs than younger populations. Overall this project was meant to see if welfare investments have a tangible impact on the support of the LDP in Japan.

## LDP Vote Map

These are two maps showing Japanese welfare spending by prefecture and their 2021 LDP vote share by prefecture. The 2015 is heavily skewed by the Fukushima disaster, which occurred in 2011. Fallout from that disaster led to an enormous increase in welfare spending, which notably did not lead to outsized electoral success for the LDP.
